#include <stdio.h>
//the question is to read and render or to read, copy into structure, array, list, whatnot and then to read from there
// the question is also how many times it needs to be accessed (we can do a read on each access), but for example 
// backtracking and so forth I don't think we should read over and over.
// What's wrong with an array of arrays

//then we need to validate the input

//then we need to use the map to create an image

//then we need to have interactiveness by having a player and actions upon playing
// and also rules for the game i.e. no going into walls, or eating the token will give you an extra point or reaching the exit means end of game

//I must make sure that the program is leak free on my end
